# Flight Fees Validation Error Fix

## Problem

The flight search was failing with a MongoDB validation error:

```
FlightResult validation failed: flights.0.price.fees.0: Cast to [string] failed for value "[\n  { amount: '0.00', type: 'SUPPLIER' },\n  { amount: '0.00', type: 'TICKETING' }\n]" (type string) at path "price.fees.0"
```

## Root Cause

The `price.fees` field was being stored as a string representation of an array instead of an actual array. This happened because:

1. **Data Serialization Issue**: Somewhere in the data processing pipeline, the fees array was being converted to a string
2. **Inconsistent Data Types**: The fees field was not being consistently validated as an array
3. **Missing Validation**: No validation was in place to ensure fees remained as an array structure

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Array Validation

**Before:**

```javascript
fees: offer.price.fees || [],
```

**After:**

```javascript
fees: Array.isArray(offer.price.fees) ? offer.price.fees : [],
```

### 2. Data Cleaning Before Database Save

Added comprehensive data cleaning before saving to database:

```javascript
const cleanedFlights = flights.map((flight) => {
  // Ensure fees is always an array
  if (flight.price && flight.price.fees) {
    if (typeof flight.price.fees === "string") {
      try {
        flight.price.fees = JSON.parse(flight.price.fees);
      } catch (e) {
        flight.price.fees = [];
      }
    }
    if (!Array.isArray(flight.price.fees)) {
      flight.price.fees = [];
    }
  }
  return flight;
});
```

### 3. Per-Traveler Pricing Fix

Also fixed the same issue in per-traveler pricing:

```javascript
fees: Array.isArray(tp.price.fees) ? tp.price.fees : [];
```

### 4. Debug Logging

Added logging to help identify when fees data is malformed:

```javascript
if (fees.length > 0) {
  console.log(
    "Processing fees for flight:",
    offer.id,
    "Fees:",
    JSON.stringify(fees)
  );
}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `server/routes/flights.js`

#### 1. **Flight Data Transformation** (Lines ~130-170)

- Added `Array.isArray()` checks for all fees fields
- Enhanced validation for main price fees and per-traveler fees
- Added debug logging for fees processing

#### 2. **Data Cleaning Before Save** (Lines ~220-250)

- Added comprehensive data cleaning function
- Handles string-to-array conversion for malformed fees
- Validates both main fees and per-traveler fees
- Provides fallback to empty array for invalid data

#### 3. **Search Record Storage** (Lines ~260-270)

- Updated analytics storage to use cleaned flight data
- Ensures consistent data structure in search records

## Validation Logic

The fix handles these scenarios:

### Main Price Fees:

- `fees: [...]` → keeps as array ✅
- `fees: "string"` → attempts JSON.parse, fallback to `[]` ✅
- `fees: null/undefined` → converts to `[]` ✅
- `fees: {}` → converts to `[]` ✅

### Per-Traveler Fees:

- Same validation logic applied to each traveler's price.fees
- Ensures consistency across all pricing structures

### Error Recovery:

- JSON parsing errors are caught and handled gracefully
- Invalid data types are converted to empty arrays
- Logging helps identify data quality issues

## Database Schema Compatibility

### FlightResult Model:

```javascript
fees: [
  {
    amount: String,
    type: String,
  },
];
```

### Expected Data Structure:

```javascript
{
  price: {
    fees: [
      { amount: "0.00", type: "SUPPLIER" },
      { amount: "85.00", type: "TAXES" },
    ];
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Cases Covered:

1. **Valid Array**: Fees as proper array of objects
2. **String Conversion**: Fees as JSON string that needs parsing
3. **Invalid String**: Fees as non-JSON string (fallback to empty array)
4. **Null/Undefined**: Missing fees field (fallback to empty array)
5. **Wrong Type**: Fees as object or other type (fallback to empty array)

### Verification Steps:

1. Flight search completes without validation errors
2. Flight results are saved to database successfully
3. Fees data is properly structured in database
4. Per-traveler pricing fees are also properly handled

## Prevention

### Future Safeguards:

1. **Type Validation**: Always use `Array.isArray()` for array fields
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean data before database operations
3. **Error Logging**: Log data quality issues for monitoring
4. **Schema Validation**: Consider adding Mongoose schema validation

### Best Practices:

- Always validate data types before database operations
- Use try-catch blocks for JSON parsing operations
- Provide meaningful fallbacks for invalid data
- Log data quality issues for debugging

- `server/FEES_VALIDATION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Verification:

1. Flight searches now complete without MongoDB validation errors
2. Fees data is properly stored as arrays in the database
3. Both main pricing and per-traveler pricing fees are handled correctly
4. Data cleaning prevents future similar issues

This fix ensures robust handling of fees data while maintaining backward compatibility and preventing database validation errors.
